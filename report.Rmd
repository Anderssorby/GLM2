# Part 1: Logistic regression

## a)
In this part we model the probability of a successful ascent of a mountain using binary regression with a logit link.
Let $y_i$ be the number of successful ascents, and let $n_i$ be the total number of attempts (sum of successful and failed) of the $i$th mountain.
The GLM model is then,


## b)

```{r}
filepath <- "https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4315/2018h/mountains"
mount <- read.table(file = filepath, header = TRUE, 
                    col.names = c("height", "prominence", "fail", "success"))
```

```{r}
model1 <- glm(cbind(success, fail) ~ height + prominence, data = mount, family = "binomial")
summary(model1)
```
